<h3>Calendar Version 4</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to Version 4 of the auto generating calender scripts.  This version was a
  complete update to standardize on the bootstrap and skeleton css libraries, and
  continues with the return-to-basics mentality of version 3, but with
  significant improvements provided by the move to PHP.  This version includes:
  <b>protected directory structures</b>, <b>site specific CSS</b>,
  <b>date based file unlocking for students</b>, and a <b>highly configurable box design.</b>
  Additionally the number of configuration files has been reduced considerably.
</p>
<p>
  Once you log onto the system, you can view the calendar unfettered and see all files
  in each of the class directories.  You can click on individual dates in the calendar
  and see all of the files that are hidden in those directories (under the name of the lecture).
  Depending on how you
  configure security, hopefully properly configured .htaccess files, this may be the
  only way to view these files via the web.
</p>
<h4>Calendar Configuration Files:</h4>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b><a href=calendar.php>calendar.php</a></b> - Primary Configuration file for the calendar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b><replace value="access_file"></replace></b> - File used to define when files or events become visible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b><replace value="class_file"></replace></b> - File used to virtually copy files into classes, labs, etc.
    </li>

  </ul>

</p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h4>Directory Structure:</h4>
<p>
  The calendar expects a directory structure where all specific types of classes
  are in their own directory.  For example, classes in one directory,
  labs in another, review sessions in another, etc.
  The contents of these directories must be in alphabetical order as that is
  how the order of classes is determined.
  <pre><code class="makefile">class/
class/A-01.Introduction to this course
class/B-02.The first class
class/B-02.The first class/notes.txt
lab/
lab/01.The first lab</code></pre>
  Directory Names, and expected file names are configured and specified in the configuration file
  (<a href=calendar.php>calendar.php</a>).
</p>

<h4>HTML</h4>
<p>
  The calendar system will present processed HTML files to your users
  in a way that will hopefully save you time in producing content.
  The default CSS for presented pages is the <b>skeleton boilerplate CSS</b> provided
  at <a href="http://getskeleton.com">getskeleton.com</a> used in conjunction with
  the bootstrap CSS libraries <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">getbootstrap.com</a>,
  the floating topbar will be automatically generated for you (see notes below),
  and all of the options listed on that page are available in your webpage design.
  All of the headers and CSS will be automatically generated for you allowing you to
  start with simple HTML.
</p>

<h4>LaTex and Formulas</h4>
<p>
  The <b>MathJax</b> library is included by default, and will allow you
  to embed laTex, which is very useful for formulas, example:
  $$
  P^i_t = P_0 + V^i_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
  $$
  To use this feature, simply surround the latex code with \$\$
  as noted below in the next section.
</p>
<p>
  We can also embed formulas inline with the text, \( a = 47 t \),
  by escaping parenthesis, see example code below:
</p>

<h4>Adding Your own CSS</h4>
<p>
  The calendar system also supports adding your own CSS to specific
  event categories (eg. class, lab, project, etc.).  This would allow
  you to provide a set of CSS that just impacts classes but not labs.
  To use this feature, within your <b>calendar.php</b> configuration page,
  add the <b>$CUSTOMCSS</b> variable, below is an example that would load
  the following files only for labs.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>docs/custom1.css</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>docs/custom2.css</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <pre><code class="PHP">$CUSTOMCSS = array('lab'=>array('docs/custom1.css', 'docs/custom2.css'));</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>Embedding Source Code</h4>
<p>
  If you want to show users code, the <b>hightlight.js</b> library is included.
  All you need to do is place the source-code between a
  <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;code&gt;</b> tags.  The library will
  attempt to guess the language that you are using, although this
  can be overriden (see example in the source to this page).
</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="tex"&gt;$$
  P^i_t = P_0 + V^i_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

\( a = 47 t \)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This results in:
</p>
<pre><code class="tex">$$
P^i_t = P_0 + V^i_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

\( a = 47 t \)</code></pre>


<a name="images"></a>
<h4>HTML &amp; Images</h4>
<p>
  HTML files are automatically processed and image names are replaced with the
  appropriately protected links.  To support this the calendar system expects
  that the image filename will always be the first element of the tag, example:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;img src="picture.jpg" width="50%"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  The image files must be located in the <b>same</b> directory as the html,
  deeper directory structures are only possible using links
  (which may not be protected and therefore is not recommended).
</p>

<a name="links"></a>
<h4>HTML &amp; Links</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to the way that images are handled, you can link to other files that
  within the <b>course</b> directory.  The format of the tag must start with
  <b>&lt;a href="</b> for the system to properly identify it as a servable link, example:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a href="additional.html" id="ifyouwantone" ... &gt;</code></pre>

<a name="menus"></a>
<h4>HTML &amp; Automatic Menubar Generation</h4>
<p>
  HTML files will be searched for the <b> &lt;a name=""&gt; </b> tags, and this data
  will be used to build a menubar at the top of the prepared HTML.  If you
  use <b>:</b> (Semicolons), then you can create dynamic menus with subcategories
  that link to specific portions on your page.  As an example, if the following was
  in an HTML file:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a name="Intro" id="Intro"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Welcome to the class ...
&lt;a name="Notes" id="One"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
...
&lt;a name="Problems" id="Problems"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  <b>Note: No spaces in links!</b>  If you want to use spaces in your names,
  replace them with a <b>-</b> instead, the system will automatically replace
  them for you on the top bar.  Example:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a name="Intro-to-CS" id="Intro-to-CS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  If you are having issues getting the locations to line up correctly,
  you can surround each area with it's own <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> class, example:
  <pre><code class="html">&lt;a name="tables"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class="docs-section" id="tables"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</p>

<a name="timelock"></a>
<h4>Setting files to be available on a certain date: <b>(legacy)</b></h4>
<p>
  Unless you are logged on, the system will automatically check the naming of
  all files to see if they are available to students.  This is particularly
  useful when you use symbolic linking, with an expected filename linked to
  specifically named file:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">Unlocked file: <b>my_powerpoint.ppt</b></code></pre>
<p>
  To make this file become available on <b>December 15th</b> rename the file
  to have the following convention:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">Locked file: <b>my_powerpoint.12.15.pptx</b></code></pre>
<p>
  Assuming that you have configured <a href=calendar.php>calendar.php</a> so that
  slides.pptx is set to present as a clickable day title (default), if it finds a
  slides.pptx file it will present it to the user.  If that file is linked to a
  date restricted file, it will not be available until that date.  Reminder: To
  make a symbolic link on linux, using the example names above:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">user@workstation$ <b>ln -s my_powerpoint.12.15.pptx slides.pptx</b></code></pre>

<h4>Setting files to be available on a certain date <b>(a better way)</b>:</h4>
<p>
  There is also the option of using a consolidated access file for time based opening.
  The file, which is named in the variable <b>$ACCESS_FILE</b> in <a href=calendar.php>calendar.php</a>
  (currently <replace value="access_file">),
  can be used as a
  central location for setting these accesses.  The format is simply <b>filename</b>,
  <b>Month</b>, and <b>Day</b> each separated by a tab.  Below is an example file.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">homework01.html	12	15
class/01.Course Overview/intro.html	12	15</code></pre>
<p>
  You can set either the complete path, or just a filename.  <b>Note:</b> if you
  use just a filename, it will catch all instances throughout the directory structure.
  In the case above, the file homework01.html, wherever is resides, will not be available until December 15th.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you are able to use generic representations for classes and events then explicitly calling
  out their filenames!
</p>
<pre><code class="html">class_1/homework    12  15
class_2/all         12  15
class_2             12  15  &larr; this has the same effect as the line above
lab_3/filename.ext  12  15</code></pre>

<p>
  By default, the calendar system uses the <b>$YEAR</b> value within calendar.php
  to set the year that will be used to unlock the file.
  If you want to set this manually this can be done within the access file, example:
</p>

<pre><code class="html">class_1/homework    12  15 2020
class_2/all         12  15 2020
class_2             12  15 2020  &larr; this has the same effect as the line above
lab_3/filename.ext  12  15 2020</code></pre>

<p>
  If you would like to set a default for an entire class of events (say all classes or all labs),
  this can be done as well.
</p>

<pre><code class="html">class                      12  15 2020
class/homework             12  15 2020
class/homework-solution    12  15 2020
lab                        12  15 2020
lab/lab-solution           12  15 2020</code></pre>


<h4>Setting files to be available on a certain date <b>(dynamically)</b>:</h4>
<p>
  Within the Calendar access file, you can also set a delta for when a file
  will become available.  Below is an example where the class will unlock
  2 days before the date of the class on the calendar.
  <pre><code class="html">class_2 -2</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Similarly you can use the <b>+</b> to have a class appear after the lecture.
  To have the item appear on the same day, just mark it as +0 or -0 days.
  <pre><code class="html">class_2 -0</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  An additional feature is the ability to set the unlock day based on day of the
  week in a similar fashion.  Example:
  <pre><code class="html">class -monday</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  In this example all classes would automatically unlock the previous monday
  (unless the day the event appears on the calendar is a monday in which case it
  will unlock on the day it appears on the calendar).  <b>Caution:</b>  if you
  declare -monday and the day on the calendar is a monday it will unlock on the
  calendar day, if you say +monday it will always change the date to the following
  monday even if the day on the calendar is a monday!)
</p>

<h5>Priorities within access file</h5>
<p>
  When building access control rules, understand that the priorities are the following (in reducing priority order):
  <ul>
    <li>class_01/filename</li>
    <li>filename</li>
    <li>class_01/category [such as homework]</li>
    <li>class/category</li>
    <li>class_01</li>
    <li>class/*</li>
    <li>class_01/all</li>
    <li>class_01/*</li>
    <li>*/category</li>
    <li>class</li>
    <li>*</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Using passwords to protect a portion of the notes (<b>and</b> possibly share with students)</h4>
<p>
  There may be a case where you would like to password protect a portion of your notes,
  but not use your instructor password.  This can be accomplished with the <b>&lt;lock code=""&gt;</b> ... <b>&lt;/lock&gt;</b> tags.
  <pre><code class="HTML">&lt;lock code="happy"&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;This information is hidden.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/lock&gt;</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  When these tags are found within the notes, they are replaced with a password prompt as seen below
</p>
<div class="jumbotron">
<form method=POST>
<label for="input-group"><font color="blue">Enter Password to See Hidden Content</font></label>
<div class="input-group">
  <input type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="" name="lock" id="lock">
  <div class="input-group-btn">
    <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></i></button>
  </div>
</div>
</form>
</div>
<p>
  Multiple passwords can be used within the tag if they are seperated by commas,
  leading/trailing whitespace will be removed.
  Each of the passwords would be considered valid to see the hidden content.
  Avoid commas in passwords.
  <pre><code class="HTML">&lt;lock code="happy,to,be,here"&gt;
  &lt;h5&gt;This information is hidden.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/lock&gt;</code></pre>
</p>

<a name="vfiles"></a>
<h4>Virtual Files</h4>
<p>
  In the event that you would like to have a specific location outside of the standard structure for
  storing files, you can create <b>virtual files</b> via a <b>class file</b> (currently <replace value="class_file">).
  The name is defined by $CLASS_FILE in the configuration file <a href=calendar.php>calendar.php</a> , and has
  a simple format: <b>virtual filename</b>, <b>actual filename</b>, <b>component type</b>,
  and <b>component number</b> each separated by a tab.  Below is an example file.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">notes.html	homework/homework01.html	lab	1
notes.tex 	docs/latex-template.tex 	class 	4</code></pre>
<p>
  These files will appear on that specific day whenever they occur.  In the example above
  lab 1 would have the files notes.html added (which links to homework/homework01.html)
  and class 4 would have a notes.tex files available (linking to docs/latex-template.tex).
</p>

<a name="notes"></a>
<h4>Embedding Instructor Notes</h4>
<p>
  The system allows you to embed notes into the html files that can only be viewed by instructors who are logged on
  by using <b>&lt;inst&gt; ... &lt;/inst&gt;</b> tags.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;inst&gt;
  &lt;font size=3 color="#D11677"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instructor Note&lt;/b&gt;:
    These notes will only be visible to &lt;b&gt;instructors&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/inst&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Embedding Revealable Answers</h4>
<p>
  Similar to the <b>inst</b>ructor tag above, if you would like to hide answers to selected problems for the students
  use <b>&lt;student&gt; ... &lt;/student&gt;</b> tags, on the page view a little magnifying glass
  will appear that will allow them to see these notes.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;student&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="php"&gt;
    $answer = "Provide the answers to your students.";
  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/student&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Embedding other files or source code</h4>
<p>
  If you would like to include another file (html, source code, etc), in your HTML files, the system can inject
  that file into the results and process the contents as if they were part of the initial web page.  There are
  two tags that will become useful.  <b>&lt;inject&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;codeinject&gt;</b>, the difference between
  the two tags is that <b>&lt;codeinject&gt;</b> will replace any <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> signs with the
  appropriate HTML so that they will be displayed correctly.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;inject src="subdirectory/example2.html"&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;codeinject src="Example.java"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In a more useful example:
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code class="java"&gt;
    &lt;codeinject src="Example.java"&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Content based on the $PAGE_MODIFY variable</h4>
<p>
  You can also edit the $PAGE_MODIFY variable in calendar.php, this is an associative
  array of key &rarr; value pairs which will be replaced in your web pages if you use the replace
  tag.  Example:
  <pre><code class="html"># calendar.php
# Dynamically change content within a page based on these variables
$PAGE_MODIFY = array('classyear'=>'18', 'something'=>'test');</code></pre>
  If, inside of your html for the day, the following line of HTML existed:
  <br><br>
  <pre><code class="html">&lt;b&gt;Welcome class of &lt;replace value="classyear"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!</code></pre>
  The result would be <b>Welcome class of 18</b>!
</p>
<p>
  A few values are automatically populated for you, unless explicitly defined in $PAGE_MODIFY, these
  include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>type</b> - What type of class we are currently in (example class, project, lab, exam...)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>ctype</b> - Same as <b>type</b>, except the first character is <b><u>C</u></b>apitalized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>event</b> - What the number of this class/lab/etc is.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>zevent</b> - What the number of this class/lab/etc is (2 digits zero filled).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>title</b> - The title of this specific class/lab/etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>course</b> - The defined course number, example: <replace value="course">.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>coursename</b> - The long title of the course, example: Web and Internet Programming
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Below is a more involved example:
  <pre><code class="html">Welcome to &lt;replace value="course"&gt;,
today we will be working on &lt;replace value="type"&gt; &lt;replace value="event"&gt;.</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Which could create the line: <b>Welcome to <replace value="course">, today we will be working on lab 1</b>.
</p>

<h4>Content based on the URL and $_GET</h4>
<p>
  Page content can be directly modified
  by the user who edits the URL, by adding the <b>url</b> tag.  Example:
  <pre><code class="html">&lt;b&gt;Hello User &lt;url value="alpha" default="m18xxxx"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  </code></pre>
  Try this by adding something like
  <code>&amp;alpha=m194141</code> to the enf of the URL on the browser bar,
  currently this results in
  <b>Hello User <url value="alpha" default="m18xxxx"></b>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: Inputs used in this fashion are stored to the PHP Session, and will
  automatically be populated into pages as long as the session is active.
</p>

<h4>Providing Search Links</h4>
<p>
  The Calendar will allow you embed code that will search for keywords or general text using
  <b>&lt;keyword&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;search&gt;</b> tags.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;keyword src="Problems"&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;search src="Interesting"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  Keywords are sections defined by <b> &lt;a name=""&gt; </b> tags (as seen above), while
  generic searches will look for any content.  <b>Note:</b> these features are case sensitive, and
  searching will accept regular expressions.
</p>

<h4>Including and Running PHP Code</h4>
<p>
  If you wish to run PHP code within the calendar, this can be done, but you must have
  the PHP in a separate file that is, in essense, being included by the class lecture notes.
  to load a set of PHP code, use the &lt;calphp src="filename.php"&gt; tag.  Below is an example
  PHP script and the associated output:
</p>
<pre><code class="PHP">&lt;php
  echo "&lt;h5&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;";
?&gt;</code></pre>
<h5>This is a <b>test</b></h5>

<p>
  You will need to take care when creating PHP scripts, a fatal error in an included script
  will cause the calendar system to stop abruptly and fail.
</p>

<h4>Embedding Editable Code</h4>
<p>
  The Calendar will allow you to use the <a href="https://ace.c9.io/">Ace Editor</a>, and
  has abstracted away the difficulty of its use via the <b>&lt;ace&gt;</b> tags.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;ace name="htmldemo" mode="html_elixir" theme="crimson_editor" height="48px"&gt;Hello World&lt;/ace&gt;</code></pre>
<ace name="htmldemo" mode="html_elixir" theme="crimson_editor" height="48px">Hello World</ace>
<br />
<p>
  Additionally you can have changes that are made update some other area on your page, by creating another <b>div</b>
  with <b>ace_</b> followed by what you called the previous as the id.  Changes in the page will automatically be
  reflected, see the demo below.  Additionally the options readonly="true" and nolinenumbers="true" will result
  in a read-only box and a box without line numbers respectively.
</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;div id="ace_htmldemo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<div id="ace_htmldemo"></div>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
